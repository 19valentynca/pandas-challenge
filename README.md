# pandas-challenge  
  
Here is my pandas challenge, run through with all the ionteractive code chunks  
The assignment was fairly eye-opening with many of the trends I observed  
Would be very interesting to run more causation/correlation tests with a couple of these factors/variables to discover how much of the discrepancies are truly caused by these factors or are just due to a wacky school district/extraneous factors.
